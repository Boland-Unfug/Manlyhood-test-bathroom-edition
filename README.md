# Manlyhood-test-bathroom-edition
A quiz to see which urinal you would use. To guys, obvious.

quiz structure
How long should the quiz be? depends on attention span, maybe 15 if short attention span, 30 if long attention span? infinite mode?
could make it more of a challenge and also add skips.
Start with predefined arrangements
at some point, begin randomly selecting from a pre-generated database of random toilet arrangements
after ~50, start adding some really wierd elements (for the lols)
    - meme ideas: multiple people at a urinal, sinks, step stool urinals, mirror dividers, balance boards
the general feel should be going from normal to impossible toilet arrangements
toilet elements
    - standard urinal
    - kids urinal
    - people at random urinals (probs following rules)
    - bathroom stall
    - number of urinals
    - dividers
add people first - then elements in the blank spaces
use specific rules that all guys know
    - minimize next door contact
    - don't stand next to someone else
Store each persons answer in a database, and show the average for each urinal
correct, use an algorithm or vote based probabilities?
